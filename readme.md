# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Your Task

Design a quiz that utilizes the skills we have learned so far in bootcamp. We are starting with no code or files. We are to design and create every aspect of this project. 

## User Story

This is the user story given in the homework assignment. The project will include a timed quiz and storing the score to the local memory.
```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

This is the acceptance criteria given to us in the homework assignment. This is only the bare minimum of what the code is support to do. 

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

## Personal Notes

```
Starting from a blank page is a daunting task. I expect to struggle with getting started. I got docked pointed from my previous homework assignment for not including a Readme file. I will try to create a better readme file for this project. Using it to document things I found difficult as I progress through the assignment.

```
